    question: "How can outsourcing save cost for me?",
    answer: `Typically, a major portion of your overhead cost is spent on employees and the related hiring, training, and onboarding process. It's both costly and time-consuming. Companies are frequently confronted with balancing current employees who are overworked against the cost of justifying a new hiring to cope with the burden. Because outsourced workers operate remotely, it saves money on office space, supplies, equipment, and resources. RDI Connect's BPO services lower the cost of in-house employees and help your firm become as efficient as possible while saving money.`,

    question: "How can outsourcing save me time?",
    answer: `A typical employee will spend roughly half of their workweek on repetitive, digital chores. However, outsourcing these repetitive operations frees up the hours that would otherwise be spent on those procedures. Outsourcing helps you to devote more time to other activities, providing variation in responsibilities for your employees rather than monotony. You should make the most of your employee's expertise, abilities, and experience.`,
